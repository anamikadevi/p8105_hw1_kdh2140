# Question 1

The following code creates a dataframe consisting of a numeric vector, a logic vector, a character vector, and a three level factor vector.

``` {r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

``` {r dataframe generation}
df_1 = tibble(vec_rand = rnorm(10),
              vec_logic = vec_rand > 0,
              vec_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", 
                           "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
              vec_factor = factor(c("mild","mild","mild","mild",
                                    "moderate", "moderate", "moderate",
                                    "severe", "severe", "severe"))
)

df_1
```

The following code attempts to take the mean of each vector. 

```{r calculation of mean}
#vec_rand
mean(rnorm(10))

#vec_logic
```
